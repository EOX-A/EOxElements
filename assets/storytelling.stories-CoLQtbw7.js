## What is Lorem Ipsum? <!--{#what}-->
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the **printing and typesetting** industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and **scrambled it to make a type specimen book.** It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Sustainable Development Goal 13 is to _**“take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”**_, [according to the United Nations](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/).

The visualizations and data below present the global perspective on where the world stands today and how it has changed over time. Further data and statistics can be found at the Our World in Data topic pages on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions and [Climate Change](https://ourworldindata.org/climate-change).

The [UN has defined](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/Global%20Indicator%20Framework%20after%202023%20refinement_Eng.pdf) 5 targets and 8 indicators for SDG 13. Targets specify the goals and indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to track whether these targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of all targets and show the data on the agreed indicators.

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

## Section 1
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Section 2
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

## EarthCODE Portal <!--{as="esa-main-section" title="EarthCODE Portal"}-->
### EarthCODE
This portal shall provide an entry point to the collaborative development tools and resources, as well as access to community guidelines and open documentation to help researchers adopt FAIR principles in their scientific practice.

Through community and capacity building focused on Open Science, the activity shall promote a trusted collaborative experience of conducting Earth system science.

Just like the European Space Agency (ESA), we advocate for and actively support Open Science, as we believe in the significance of collaborative efforts in advancing scientific knowledge and addressing global challenges. We acknowledge the transformative power of Open Science in driving interdisciplinary collaboration, facilitating reproducibility, and ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and resilient future for our world.

The OSC aims to advance science initiatives and projects by providing a platform to store catalog records for science themes, variables, projects, products, and contributing (EO) missions. This system allows users an easy way to browse, search, and access metadata information associated with these records. This blog post provides some technical details about the OSC.

## OSC <!--{as="div" style="width: 100%;"}-->
![](https://eox.at/images/osc-title.jpg) <!--{style="min-width: 40vw;"}-->

The contents of the catalog is actually managed by a public GitHub repository, allowing for a full history of changes to the contents of records. Additionally changes to the repository are done using the mechanism of a Pull Request. Users can suggest changes, which can be revised by the data administrators of the Open Science Catalog, and run through rigorous checks using GitHub actions, which perform checks on the validity and the integrity of the changes. When a Pull Request is accepted, the changes are incorporated in the main branch of the catalog, triggering a new release of the static catalog, which is subsequently merged into the resource catalog.

## FutureEO <!--{as="esa-main-section"}-->
### FutureEO
For all components (technology, community, partnerships), the Reproducible Open Science Environment can rely on elements developed as part of other FutureEO activities and on readily available operational services provided by Member States' public and industrial facilities, including interoperable building blocks, platform services, Open Science capacity building, scientific communication, and international cooperation.`},render:e=>o`
