## Introduction
EOxElements is a collection of web components for Earth Observation data visualization and interaction.

## Available Elements

- [eox-chart](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/docs/elements-chart--docs): Chart component based on [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)/[Vega-Embed](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed).
- [eox-drawtools](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/docs/elements-drawtools--docs): The `eox-drawtools` element provides a comprehensive set of drawing, editing, selection, and import tools for vector features on an `eox-map`. It supports drawing multiple feature types (Polygon, Box, Point, Circle, LineString), continuous drawing, feature modification, selection from existing layers, and import/export in various formats (GeoJSON, WKT, native OL feature).
- [eox-feedback](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/docs/elements-feedback--docs): The `eox-feedback` element provides a modal dialog for collecting user feedback. It supports screenshot capture, customizable endpoint, and flexible styling.
- [eox-geosearch](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/docs/elements-geosearch--docs): `eox-geosearch` provides a flexible geocoding and location search interface using the OpenCage API.
- [eox-itemfilter](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/docs/elements-itemfilter--docs): The `eox-itemfilter` element provides a comprehensive item filtering system for lists of items with flexible filter types, result aggregation, and customizable display modes.
